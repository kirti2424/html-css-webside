                <h1> About US</h1>
                <h5>Italian <span> Pizza </span></h5>
                <p> Italian is all about quality you can trust. As one of the original founding Pizza brands and the 3rd largest
                    Pizza chain in India, our sole mission is making the freshest, tastiest and funnest Pizza around.

                    Our classic pan pizza will always be a fan favourite, with a soft and chewy crust perfectly
                    balancing out the healthy tomato pure and mozzarella - cheddar blended cheese.

                    Our authentic Italian crust for those who would prefer a light and airy crust to more fully enjoy
                    the toppings. Thin, light and delicious.

                    Our newest addition of Puree sauces will blow your mind. Chose between a spicy buffalo, sweet bbq,
                    tangy chipotle can creamy makhni to perfectly compliment your toppings and crust. Our suggestions of
                    combinations might be helpful but ultimately the power lies with you.

                    Contrary to industry standard strategy, USPizza, since 1996, has been committed to growing our brand
                    slowly and steadily. Every outlet is carefully selected on strict criteria. To be a USPizza
                    franchisee is a privilege unto itself. The same commitment to product and service perfection we
                    practice is expected from our partners.</p>
